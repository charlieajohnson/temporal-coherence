\caption{Auditability under collapsed versus propagated time. \conceptual\; When timestamps are rewritten or normalised (top), historical system state cannot be reconstructed; when temporal uncertainty is preserved (bottom), the system retains an explicit boundary between what was known and what was not, enabling post-hoc audit, explanation, and governance.}
