\caption{Timestamp collapse versus queryable time. \conceptual\; When timestamps are collapsed to points (top), systems enforce a total ordering that makes causal queries appear answerable even when that ordering is unjustified; when temporal uncertainty is propagated (bottom), overlapping event intervals expose ambiguity, making causal queries explicit rather than silently wrong.}
