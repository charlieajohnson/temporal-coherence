# temporal-coherence
Architectural primitives for reasoning about time under intermittency, drift, and delayed observation.

This repository collects notes, figures, and reference material around a recurring systems failure mode: when time becomes non-queryable under long-horizon, intermittent operation.

The goal is not to propose a new synchronisation protocol, but to articulate the minimal architectural properties required for temporal coherence to survive drift, buffering, and delayed observation.
